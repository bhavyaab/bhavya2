    paragraph: 'jQuery is a cross-platform JavaScript library designed to simplify the client-side scripting of HTML.[3] jQuery is the most popular JavaScript library in use today, with installation on 65% of the top 10 million highest-trafficked sites on the Web.[4][5][6] jQuery is free, open-source software licensed under the MIT License.[2]. jQuery\'s syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.',
